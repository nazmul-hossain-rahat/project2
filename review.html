The Long Version
Yeah ok, it’s probably not going to be the coolest piece of snowboarding kit you’ll own.

Hell, some might even argue that it is uncool — covering the sick design of your new board with a slab of ugly rubber.

But for beginners or resort riders spending most of their day loading and unloading from a resort chairlift, a snowboard stomp pad can help make your day that much less stressful and — consequently — more enjoyable.</P>
